# Dependencies

npm is the only package manager (`package-lock.json`). Core libraries that touch money, data or sign-in are pinned to exact versions; UI helpers use caret ranges and are locked by `package-lock.json`.

Rules: add a package only when the shared domain or a port can't do it; record it here; never commit registry cache URLs in `package-lock.json` (registry.npmjs.org only).

Audit overrides (package.json): `brace-expansion@1` → 1.1.21, `brace-expansion@5` → 5.0.12, `uuid` → 11.1.1 (only exceljs uses it), `@esbuild-kit/core-utils > esbuild` → 0.25.12. Never run `npm audit fix --force`; it downgrades exceljs to 3.4.0.
npm 11 or newer is required: npm 10 rejects this lock file in `npm ci`. CI uses Node 24. Install scripts: approve only `esbuild` (it fetches its own build tool); core-js only prints a donation message.

drizzle-kit stays: Lovable's database-change tool writes and applies migrations through it (drizzle/migrations). The two "@esbuild-kit" deprecation notices come from it and are harmless. Copies of every migration also live in supabase/migrations for self-hosting.
eslint 10 runs with the two classic React hook rules; the newer React Compiler rules in eslint-plugin-react-hooks 7 are not enabled yet (roadmap).
