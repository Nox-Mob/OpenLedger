# Desktop edition (Phase 4) — SQLite bridge

Status: storage layer done and tested; the Tauri shell itself is not built yet.

## What exists

- `src/lib/adapters/sqlite/` — SQLite implementation of every repository port.
  - `schema.ts`: append-only migrations, applied on each start by `migrateSqlite()`.
  - Guards that mirror the Postgres triggers: entries and transactions can't be edited
    or deleted, void can't be undone, books lock, audit log is append-only, finished
    statement checks lock their entries, bank rows dedupe by FITID or hash+row,
    and a bank row can only link to a transaction with a matching amount and account.
  - Balance check at commit time (SQLite has no deferred constraints).
- `sqljs-driver.ts` — WebAssembly SQLite driver used by tests.
- `src/lib/adapters/contract.test.ts` — the same workflow tests run against the
  memory adapter and the SQLite adapter. Any new adapter must be added here.

## Wiring the Tauri shell (next step, needs Rust toolchain on a dev machine)

1. `npm install @tauri-apps/api @tauri-apps/plugin-sql` and `cargo tauri init`;
   enable `tauri-plugin-sql` with the `sqlite` feature.
2. Driver (plugin-sql already matches `SqlDriver`):
   ```ts
   import Database from "@tauri-apps/plugin-sql";
   const raw = await Database.load("sqlite:openledgerapp.db");
   const driver = {
     execute: (sql, p) => raw.execute(sql, p),
     select: (sql, p) => raw.select(sql, p),
   };
   await migrateSqlite(driver);
   const repos = createSqliteRepositories(driver);
   ```
3. A desktop build calls `src/lib/services/*` directly from the UI with these repos
   (no server functions, no sign-in; one local user is the admin).
4. Build as a static SPA (no SSR) for the Tauri webview.

## Known limits

- plugin-sql uses a connection pool; `BEGIN/COMMIT` must run on one connection.
  Set the pool to a single connection or move `post()` into one Rust command.
- Ready for the desktop UI through `src/lib/services/`: transactions, opening balances,
  bank rows (`ledger.ts`), statement checks (`reconciliation.ts`), reports (`reports.ts`),
  and organization settings, books lock and year-end close (`settings.ts`).
- Still cloud-only: member management, sign-in/legal acceptance, file import parsing and
  AI PDF reading, categories/tags/funds setup. These need ports before the desktop UI can use them.
- Sync between desktop and cloud is not designed yet; app-generated UUIDs keep that possible.

## Startup flow

- `npm run tauri dev` runs `dev:desktop` (`--mode desktop`, which loads `.env.desktop` with `VITE_EDITION=desktop`); `build:desktop` builds a static single-page app into `.output/public`.
- `isDesktop()` (`src/lib/edition.ts`) is the only edition check. On desktop, website and sign-in pages redirect via `desktopEntryRedirect`: no local organization opens `/onboarding`, otherwise `/ledger` for the last-used organization.
- The signed-in layout uses one fixed local user (`LOCAL_USER_ID`) as admin; no sign-in or legal acceptance gate.
- Organization setup saves through `createOrganizationWithAccounts` with the local SQLite file (`src/lib/desktop/local-repos.ts`).
- Every exported server function is wrapped with `desktopAware(name, fn)` (`src/lib/desktop/bridge.ts`). On desktop the call goes to `callLocal` in `src/lib/desktop/local-api.ts`, which runs the same `src/lib/services/*` workflow against the local SQLite file; on the web it calls the server as before. Pages need no changes.
- Answered locally: organizations and settings, account setup, accounts and opening balances, transactions (post, void, list), bank rows (list, post), all reports, books lock, month and year close, reopen, and statement checks.
- Not yet local (shows "isn't available in the desktop app yet. Nothing was recorded."): members and invites, account deletion, bank file import and PDF reading, budgets, funds and pledges, categories and tags (lists are empty), backups, exports and history. Each needs a port and SQLite tables first.
