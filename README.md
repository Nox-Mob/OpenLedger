# Open Ledger

Open-source, self-hostable double-entry accounting for very small businesses and nonprofits.

- Double-entry is enforced twice: in the app and again by a database trigger (every posted transaction needs at least 2 entries that sum to zero, with at least one debit and one credit).
- Bank imports are evidence only — they never change the ledger until you post them.
- Posted records are never edited in place: void and re-enter, so the audit trail stays intact.
- Every organization's data is isolated by row-level security in the database.

Built with React 19 + TanStack Start (Vite), Tailwind CSS v4, and Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage).

## Running the sample-data setup file manually

The sample data (the shared `demo@demo.org` / `demo1234` login and its two sample organizations) lives in `supabase/seed/demo.sql`. It is **not** a migration and never runs automatically. To load it into a development or test database:

```sh
psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -f supabase/seed/demo.sql
```

- `$SUPABASE_DB_URL` is the Postgres connection string of your **dev/test** database (on Supabase: Project Settings → Database → Connection string). You need a role that can write to `auth.users` (the `postgres` superuser works).
- The script is re-runnable: every insert uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so running it twice is safe.
- **Never run it against a production database with real users.** It creates a publicly known login.

## Self-hosting: full reproduction guide

Pick **one** path for the database and sign-in service, then finish with the shared steps.

| | Path 1 — Cloud-hosted Supabase | Path 2 — Self-hosted Supabase (Docker) |
|---|---|---|
| Where data lives | supabase.com | Your own server |
| Effort | Easiest | More setup, 4 GB+ RAM |
| Migrations run with | `psql` on your machine or `supabase db push` | `docker exec` into the `supabase-db` container (no host `psql` needed) |

### Shared prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (or Bun 1.1+) and **Git**.
- Get the code:

  ```sh
  git clone <this-repository-url>
  cd <repository-name>
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

---

### Path 1 — Cloud-hosted Supabase (supabase.com)

1. **Create a project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. **Collect credentials** (Project Settings → API and → Database): project URL, publishable (anon) key, service-role key, and the database connection string (`SUPABASE_DB_URL`).
3. **Install the Postgres client** if you don't have `psql` (Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install -y postgresql-client`; macOS: `brew install libpq`). If you see `You must install at least one postgresql-client-<version> package`, this is the fix.
4. **Apply every migration** in filename order:

   ```sh
   export SUPABASE_DB_URL="<your connection string>"
   for f in supabase/migrations/*.sql; do
     echo "Applying $f..."
     psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f "$f"
   done
   ```

   Or with the Supabase CLI: `supabase link --project-ref <ref> && supabase db push`.
5. **Configure sign-in** (Authentication → Sign In / Providers): enable Email; keep email confirmation ON for production; optionally enable Google. Under URL Configuration set **Site URL** to your app's URL and add `<app-url>/reset-password` (and your local dev URL) to the redirect list.
6. **Fill in `.env`:**

   ```sh
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<publishable/anon key>
   SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<publishable/anon key>
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-role key>
   LOVABLE_API_KEY=<optional, enables AI PDF import>
   ```

7. *(Optional, dev/test only)* load sample data: `psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -f supabase/seed/demo.sql`.

Continue with **Run the app** below.

---

### Path 2 — Self-hosted Supabase with Docker

Runs Postgres, Auth, Storage and the API on your own machine. Allow **4 GB+ RAM**.

1. **Install Supabase's Docker stack.** The quickest way is the official script:

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://supabase.link/setup.sh | sh
   ```

   The script supports **Linux only** (Debian/Ubuntu and RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) and will:

   - Install prerequisites (`git`, `openssl`, `jq`) and Docker Engine if not already present
   - Sparse-clone the `docker/` directory from the main Supabase repository
   - Create a project directory (`supabase-project` by default) and copy the configuration files into it
   - Record the installed release version in `.supabase-version` for future `update.sh` upgrades
   - Prompt for the main URLs (`SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL`, `API_EXTERNAL_URL`, `SITE_URL`, `PROXY_DOMAIN`) and write them to `.env`
   - Generate all secrets, including a random `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`, and the asymmetric JWT signing key pair (runs `generate-keys.sh` and `add-new-auth-keys.sh`, and enables the matching entries in `docker-compose.yml`)
   - Pull the Docker images

   > The shortened link points to `setup.sh` — inspect it first if you prefer (`curl -fsSL https://supabase.link/setup.sh -o setup.sh`, read it, then `sh setup.sh`). Use `-y` to run non-interactively with default values. Manual alternative: `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase && cd supabase/docker && cp .env.example .env`, set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ANON_KEY`, `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` yourself, then `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

2. **Log out and back in.** If the script installed Docker, it added you to the `docker` group; otherwise the `docker` commands below need `sudo`.
3. **Start the stack and view credentials:**

   ```sh
   cd supabase-project && sh run.sh start
   sh run.sh secrets      # shows ANON_KEY, SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, ...
   ```

   The API gateway listens on port `8000`: your project URL is `http://<server-ip>:8000` (or your TLS URL if you put a proxy in front).
4. **Apply every migration inside the database container.** Go back to *this app's* project folder and run the migrations through Docker — you do **not** need `psql` installed on the host:

   ```sh
   # Confirm the database container name (usually supabase-db)
   docker ps --filter "name=db" --format "{{.Names}}"

   for file in supabase/migrations/*.sql; do
     echo "Applying $file..."
     docker exec -i supabase-db psql -U postgres -d postgres -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < "$file"
   done
   ```

   If `docker ps` shows a different name (e.g. `supabase-project-db-1`), use that instead of `supabase-db`.
5. **Fill in `.env`** — the browser and server values are the same here:

   ```sh
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://<server-ip>:8000
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<ANON_KEY>
   SUPABASE_URL=http://<server-ip>:8000
   SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<ANON_KEY>
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<SERVICE_ROLE_KEY>
   LOVABLE_API_KEY=<optional, enables AI PDF import>
   ```

6. **Check the sign-in URLs.** If your app's URL differs from what you entered during setup, edit `SITE_URL` and `ADDITIONAL_REDIRECT_URLS` (include `<app-url>/reset-password`) in `supabase-project/.env`, then `docker compose restart auth`.
7. *(Optional, home/lab use)* **skip email verification.** By default, new users must click a link in a confirmation email before they can sign in. On a home server without email set up, that leaves everyone stuck. To let people use the app right after signing up, edit `supabase-project/.env` and set:

   ```sh
   MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM=true
   ```

   Then restart the auth service: `docker compose restart auth`. New sign-ups are marked as confirmed automatically. **Only do this on a private network you trust** — with it on, anyone who can reach your server can create an account with any email address, real or not. Leave it `false` anywhere the app is reachable from the internet.

8. *(Optional, dev/test only)* load sample data:

   ```sh
   docker exec -i supabase-db psql -U postgres -d postgres < supabase/seed/demo.sql
   ```

8. **Backups.** Dump nightly and copy off the machine:

   ```sh
   docker exec supabase-db pg_dump -U postgres postgres | gzip > backup-$(date +%F).sql.gz
   # test a restore at least once:
   gunzip -c backup.sql.gz | docker exec -i supabase-db psql -U postgres postgres
   ```

Updating Supabase later: run the stack's `update.sh` from `supabase-project` (version recorded in `.supabase-version`). App and Supabase updates are independent; neither touches your data. New app migrations are applied with the same `docker exec` loop (already-applied ones may report "already exists" — only new files matter).

---

### Run the app (both paths)

```sh
bun install        # or: npm install
bun run dev        # or: npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:8080, create your first account, and the app walks you through creating your first organization. With sample data loaded you can sign in as `demo@demo.org` / `demo1234`.

Production build:

```sh
bun run build
bun run preview    # serves the production build
```

The app is server-rendered: pages **and** server functions run on the server, so a static-file host alone will not work. App servers are stateless and can be replaced or multiplied freely.

---

## Deploying

### Before any deployment

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or your host's secret store) and fill it in. `.env` is git-ignored — never commit it. The service-role key is server-only.
2. Apply migrations to the production database (`supabase db push`). Migrations are append-only; never run `supabase/seed/demo.sql` in production.
3. Set Auth → URL Configuration (Site URL + `/reset-password` redirect) to your production domain.
4. Leave `VITE_ALLOW_DEMO_LOGIN` unset.
5. Run the release checklist below.

### Option A — a single server (small office, home lab)

One Linux VM (1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM is enough for a handful of users) plus a hosted Supabase project.

```sh
# on the server
git clone <repo> /opt/open-ledger && cd /opt/open-ledger
cp .env.example .env && nano .env      # fill in values; chmod 600 .env
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
```

Run it under a process manager so it restarts on crash and boot, e.g. systemd (`/etc/systemd/system/open-ledger.service`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Open Ledger
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/opt/open-ledger
EnvironmentFile=/opt/open-ledger/.env
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/bun run preview --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
Restart=always
User=openledger

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now open-ledger
```

Put a TLS reverse proxy in front (Caddy is simplest — it gets certificates automatically):

```
books.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

Updating: `git pull && bun install --frozen-lockfile && supabase db push && bun run build && sudo systemctl restart open-ledger`. Restarting never touches data.

#### Fully self-contained alternative

Use **Path 2 — Self-hosted Supabase with Docker** above on the same server, then run the app as shown here.

### Option B — at scale (many organizations / users)

```text
 users ──> CDN / load balancer (TLS)
              │
     ┌────────┼────────┐
   app #1   app #2   app #N      (stateless, identical env vars)
     └────────┼────────┘
              │
   Supabase: Postgres (+ connection pooler, read replicas)
             Auth, Storage (bank statement files)
```

- **App tier.** The build targets edge/Worker runtimes, so the lowest-effort scale path is Cloudflare Workers (`wrangler deploy`, secrets via `wrangler secret put`). Alternatively build a container image and run N replicas behind a load balancer (Kubernetes, ECS, Fly.io, Render). No sticky sessions needed — auth is a bearer token on every request. Add a `/` health check.
- **Database.** Use a paid Supabase plan (or managed Postgres you operate) with point-in-time recovery enabled. Use the connection pooler for server traffic. Scale compute vertically first; reports already page through rows, so add read replicas only when report traffic dominates.
- **Secrets.** Store keys in the platform's secret manager, not files on disk. Rotate the service-role and publishable keys on a schedule and immediately if one leaks; redeploy the app tier after rotating.
- **Releases.** Let CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) pass, apply migrations first (they are additive, so old app versions keep working), then roll out app replicas gradually.
- **Monitoring & backups.** Ship server logs to a log service, alert on 5xx rates and database CPU/connections, and test restoring a backup at least quarterly.
- **Email.** Configure a custom SMTP provider in Auth so sign-up and password-reset emails aren't rate-limited.

### Running the tests

```sh
bun run test               # unit tests: money, terminology, account catalog, reports, dates, parsers, permissions
bun run check:migrations   # every public table has GRANTs + row level security
# Database rules — ONLY against a disposable database (e.g. `supabase db start`):
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres bun run test:db
```

The database checks (`supabase/tests/*.sql`) run inside a transaction that always rolls back. They verify tenant isolation (a stranger can't read or change any org table) and ledger invariants (unbalanced/single-entry transactions rejected, entries and posted transactions immutable, voids can't be undone, books lock enforced, no cross-org entries, last admin kept).

### Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push, pull request, and weekly. It **only reports** — it never formats, fixes, commits, or pushes. Blocking jobs: unit tests, type check, production build, database rules (on a fresh local database with every migration applied), and high/critical dependency vulnerabilities. Lint is reported but not blocking yet. Each failure explains which rule broke in the run summary and as inline annotations.

## License

See LICENSE. This is pre-1.0 software — test it with sample data before trusting it with real books.

## Before you release

1. `bun run test`, `bun run lint`, `bun run format:check`, `bun run check:migrations` all pass.
2. `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres bun run test:db` passes (local throwaway DB only — the script refuses anything else).
3. `python3 scripts/smoke/smoke.py` against a dev server with the demo seed reports "No problems found."
4. Add the operator mailing address and have the Terms and Privacy Policy reviewed by counsel before release.
5. Leave `VITE_ALLOW_DEMO_LOGIN` unset in production so the shared demo login is refused.

**Startup never resets data.** Migrations only ever add to the database; CI rejects any migration containing DELETE, TRUNCATE or DROP TABLE. Restarting the app or the database keeps every organization and transaction. The demo seed refuses to load into a database that has real organizations.
