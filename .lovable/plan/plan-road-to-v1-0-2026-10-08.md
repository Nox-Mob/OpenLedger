# Plan: road to v1.0

Based on the security and controls review and the 1.0 feature review. Both say: keep the current design, no rewrite, and make 1.0 about trust (correct books, reconciliation, nonprofit funds, permissions, recovery) rather than a long feature list.

1.0 is the **web edition** (cloud and self-hosted). Desktop ships separately, only when its native storage is proven.

## Review findings and how each is handled

| Finding | Action | Release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| .env is tracked in Git | Keep it (Lovable needs it). It only holds public keys. Add a CI check that fails if any private key shape ever appears in it; document why it is tracked | v0.0.6 (done) |
| Prove "change and history roll back together" everywhere | Add a failure test for every remaining high-impact change: member removal, ownership transfer, org delete, invite claim, settings | v0.0.6 (done) |
| Direct-write check is text matching only | Add a code-structure rule that also catches multi-line calls, helper functions and admin-client use outside approved files | v0.0.6 (done) |
| Dev-only packages not audited | Add a separate full audit that reports but does not block | v0.0.6 (done) |
| Architecture doc out of date | Done in this change | now |
| Concurrent requests (double close, double post) | Tests that send the same request twice at once | v0.0.7 (still open) |
| SQLite tested with sql.js only | Native driver tests before any desktop release | Desktop track |

## v0.0.6 - Safety, controls and reports (released 2026-10-08)

Done: MFA (org can require it), delete my account, session safety, rollback tests, structural direct-write rule, .env check, full dependency audit, keyboard walk-through, release checklist.
Pulled in early: all v0.0.7 reports (general ledger, account activity, statement check, drill-down, cash basis labels, fund reports, 50k speed test), Export all to Excel and PDF, accounting-format Excel, plain report names in Settings, treasurer role and plain-language error pop-ups from v0.0.8.

## v0.0.7 - Concurrency and people checks

1. Tests that send the same request twice at once: double post, double close, double restore.
2. Screen reader walk-through by a person.
3. Password reset email checked end to end by hand.

## v0.0.8 - Periods

1. Month close with warnings (unreconciled accounts, open statement checks).
2. Audited reopen by an admin or treasurer.

## v0.0.9 - Everyday use

1. Transaction templates and recurring drafts (never auto-posted).
2. Search and filters across transactions.
3. Budget vs actual for funds and projects; board report package (one PDF).
4. Guided first-run checklist; support and diagnostics page (version, database type, last backup).

## v0.1.0 to v0.9.x - Hardening

- Self-hosted installer and tested upgrade from the previous release.
- Backup restore tested across versions.
- Real users (non-accountants) complete common tasks with the docs.
- Security disclosure policy and contact published.

## v1.0 release gates (all required)

1. Accounting correctness: every report ties to the ledger.
2. Security and permissions: isolation, authorization and membership changes covered by automated tests.
3. Import and statement checks work end to end on a real statement.
4. Backup and recovery: full restore works; a failed restore changes nothing.
5. Clean install and upgrade both work.
6. A non-accountant can do common tasks.
7. Support, privacy and vulnerability-reporting pages published.

## Left out of 1.0

Bank feeds, invoices and bills, payroll, multi-currency, desktop and cloud sync, donor CRM, custom report builder, consolidation across organizations. AI statement reading stays opt-in and never posts by itself.

## Technical details

- .env check: CI step greps `.env` for `service_role`, `sb_secret_`, and JWT payloads with role service_role; fails if found.
- Structural direct-write rule: a custom ESLint rule (AST) over `src/lib/*.functions.ts` and `src/routes/**` flagging `.from(...).insert|update|delete|upsert` chains and `client.server` imports outside an allowlist; existing regex test stays.
- Atomicity tests use the memory adapter plus new `supabase/tests/*.sql` checks with a forced failure after the data step.
- Treasurer role needs a new `app_role` enum value (additive migration) and new CAPABILITIES rows pinned by test.
- Month close reuses `books_locked_through` and period_closes; reopen goes through audited_write.
