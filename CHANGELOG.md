# Changelog

Notable changes to OpenLedgerApp are recorded here. This project follows the structure of Keep a Changelog. Pre-1.0 software remains under active development.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Desktop start: the desktop app skips the public website, sign-in and legal acceptance. First launch opens organization setup, which saves to the local file; later launches open the ledger for the last-used organization. Run with `npm run tauri dev` (uses the new `dev:desktop` and `build:desktop` scripts).
- Desktop data: pages read and save through the shared workflows against the local file instead of the cloud: accounts, transactions, bank rows, reports, books close and reopen, and statement checks. Features not yet stored locally say so and record nothing.
- Desktop release workflow: on main, after every CI check and the desktop install check pass, builds Linux, Windows and macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel) installers into a draft GitHub release for manual testing. macOS builds are unsigned.
- Desktop install check: builds and installs the Linux package, starts the app with no screen and confirms the local database is created with the ledger tables. Runs on pull requests to main and before every desktop release.

### Changed

- Releases are now two steps: prepare and wait for GitHub checks, then bump the version, date the changelog and update the architecture doc.
- The desktop app reads its version from package.json.
- CI run groups include the workflow name so the release workflow and normal CI no longer cancel each other.
- `.gitignore` now skips test results, caches, the desktop build folder and local database files; the public `.env.desktop` setting is tracked so GitHub builds the desktop edition.

### Fixed

- Dropdown menus (currency, fiscal year and others) showed white text on white in dark mode.
- Desktop build failed because of a malformed permissions file.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- Month-end close (Settings, Close the books): pick a month, see warnings for bank, cash and credit card accounts not checked against a statement through month end and for unfinished statement checks, then close. Closing with warnings needs a confirmation, and the warnings are saved in history.
- Audited reopen: admins and treasurers can reopen closed books only with a written reason (at least 10 characters), saved in history with who did it and which closed years were reopened.
- Concurrency tests: the same post, void, year-end close or month close sent at the same moment records once; a post racing a close never lands inside the closed period; restoring one backup twice at once makes two complete, separate organizations with no shared records.

### Changed

- The plain Unlock button is gone. Moving the books lock backward now always goes through Reopen books with a reason.

### Fixed

- Two restores running at the same moment could load different database clients; the restore now loads one shared client.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Reports: "Export all (PDF)" saves every report in one PDF, each on its own page.
- Treasurer role, between admin and member: records transactions, closes the year, locks the books and reopens finished statement checks, but cannot change settings or people. The database enforces the same limits.
- Plain-language error pop-ups for unbalanced transactions, closed periods, statement checks that are off, rejected backups and missing permissions. Each one says clearly that nothing was recorded.
- Tests: each common failure runs through the real bookkeeping steps; the pop-up appears only when the step is refused, never when it succeeds, and the stored books and history are checked to be unchanged. A changed backup is refused before any write; a database check (treasurer_role.sql) for what treasurers and members can and cannot do.
- Reports: general ledger and account activity with opening, running and closing balances.
- Reports: click any account on the income statement, balance sheet or trial balance to see the transactions behind it.
- Reports: fund activity (opening, received, spent, released, closing) for nonprofits.
- Reports: statement check report listing matched and outstanding items with the difference.
- Report names follow the wording setting (for example, Simplest shows "Every Transaction", "Totals Check", "Money by Purpose" and "Bank Statement Check"), and each can be changed in Settings.
- Excel exports show amounts in Accounting format (currency symbol on the left, thousands separators, negatives in parentheses) in a monospaced font.
- Reports: "Export all" saves every report in one Excel file, one sheet per report.
- Accounts page explains what accounts are and how to use them; the invite screen lists what Member, Admin and View only can do.
- Every report shows its period and "Cash basis", and the new reports export to CSV, Excel and PDF.
- Tests for the new report math, including a 50,000-line speed check.

### Added

- Two-step sign-in with an authenticator app, in Settings, Security. Admins can require it for the whole organization; the database then hides the books from any session that didn't use it.
- Delete my account, in Settings, Security. Blocked while you own an organization or are its only admin. History keeps your past changes and shows them as "Deleted user".
- Release checklist (docs/release-checklist.md): the changelog and the architecture document must be updated before every release, checked by an automated test.
- Structural code check: server functions, screens and components can't write tables directly, and only approved server files may load the privileged database client.
- Database checks for invite reuse, last-admin removal, wrong-owner transfer, settings that match nothing, organization delete, removed-member access and two-step sign-in.
- GitHub fails the build if a private key ever lands in the committed .env file, and reports developer-tool vulnerabilities without blocking.

### Changed

- Deleting an organization now saves its deleted-organization record and the delete in one step.
- Keyboard focus is now outlined clearly on every page.

### Fixed

- Database: the treasurer settings guard now applies only to signed-in app users, so server and maintenance steps are not blocked.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Organization switcher in the sidebar for people in more than one organization, showing each organization's type and your role.
- Accounts that were never used can now be deleted from Settings, Accounts. Accounts with any activity can still only be archived.
- Account, category, tag, project and fund names must be unique within an organization, ignoring capital letters and extra spaces.
- Shared input checks for amounts, dates and names, so every form gives the same clear message (for example, more than two decimal places is refused instead of rounded).
- Loading, empty and error screens with a "Try again" button on the main pages, instead of blank pages.
- Accessibility: every form field has a label for screen readers, a "Skip to content" link, labelled wording sliders, and higher-contrast sidebar text. An automated scan of every page reports no issues in light or dark mode.

### Changed

- Year-end close now saves the close, the book lock and the history entry in one step. If any part fails, nothing is kept.
- Every history entry now also stores the exact change the database applied, shown on the History page as "Saved change".
- Charts library upgraded to version 3 and the code checker to version 10.
- Loose types removed from app code; the code checker now blocks new ones, along with React rules that catch layout pieces rebuilt on every change.
- Long dashes removed from account descriptions and messages.

### Fixed

- Retrying a pledge or pledge payment after an interrupted save now finishes recording it instead of skipping it.
- Creating a project with a budget or a restricted fund failed; both save correctly again.
- The pledge form and year-end close could offer archived accounts.
- Import column pickers and statement-check tables no longer rebuild themselves on every change, which could drop keyboard focus.
- The GitHub database checks were missing the name and delete protections, so their test failed.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- History page can be filtered by type: money, setup and settings, or system.
- Backups now record the app version and include a reserved slot for future attachments (format v3). Older v2 backups still restore.
- Permissions live in one fixed table, with a test that pins every role and action.
- Full-year business and nonprofit test scenarios check reports against fixed expected totals.
- Core libraries are pinned to exact versions; see docs/dependencies.md.
- More automated tests: the audited-write helper, database checks for audited writes and their history, the migration safety script, app version against the changelog, and roll-back checks for every statement-check step, bank-row post and reconciliation finish.

### Changed

- If a change can't be recorded in history, the request now fails with an error instead of reporting success.
- Posting or voiding a transaction now saves the transaction and its history entry together. If either fails, nothing is kept.
- Adding accounts, categories, tags, projects and funds, changing a fund's restriction, recording pledges and pledge payments, and saving import layouts now save their history entry in the same step.
- A new automatic check stops any feature from saving to the database without going through the shared code. It runs on every change.
- Settings, account setup, members and invites, budgets, statement checks, imports and pledge status changes are now saved together with their history entry. If either fails, nothing is kept.
- History entries are now sorted into changes, money and system events.
- npm (version 11 or newer) is now the only supported package manager; `package-lock.json` is the only lock file and automated checks install with `npm ci` on Node 24.
- Added an architecture overview in docs/architecture.md.

### Fixed

- Every `npm audit` warning is resolved without downgrades (brace-expansion, uuid inside the Excel export library, esbuild inside the database config tool).
- A database safety check no longer reports a false failure when a fund and its history save correctly.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- Fund accounting for nonprofits: restricted and unrestricted funds, fund balances, net assets with and without donor restrictions, and releases from restriction.
- Pledges: record promised gifts, take payments, and write off what will not arrive.
- Invite links: admins create single use links with a role that expire after 7 days, and can revoke them.
- Members can be removed, anyone except the owner can leave, owners can transfer ownership to another admin, and owners can delete an organization after typing its name.
- Budgets: set a yearly or monthly budget for each income and expense account and compare it to actual results.
- Exports: reports and all transactions download as CSV or Excel, with protection against spreadsheet formula tricks.
- Full backup: admins can download one signed file with everything in an organization. Any change to the file is detected.
- Restore: a backup is restored into a new organization after its signature and every record are checked, and every transaction is re-checked against the bookkeeping rules. Backups from another install can be restored and are labeled with that install's fingerprint.
- Backup regression tests cover exporting and restoring 1,500 transactions with 4,500 ledger lines, related records, unchanged reports, and cleanup after a simulated restore failure.

### Changed

- Restore now has a clearly labeled backup file button, shows the selected filename, and highlights the organization name required for confirmation.

### Fixed

- Deleting an organization that has transactions no longer fails.
- History: admins can browse who changed what and when, under Settings.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- High-contrast dark mode with a toggle in the website header and the app sidebar. It remembers your choice and follows the system preference on first visit.
- Public website explaining OpenLedgerApp's purpose, limitations, and development status.
- Clear distinction between available self-hosted web source and planned desktop and managed-cloud editions.
- Getting-started page linking to the source archive on GitHub (the app source, without the public website).
- Product blueprint for v0.0.3 desktop-ready foundations and later optional synchronization.

### Changed

- Groundwork for the future desktop edition: a local SQLite storage option with the same bookkeeping protections, tested against the same rules as the cloud app (not yet packaged as an app).
- Statement checks, reports, organization settings, books lock and year-end close now run in the same shared, storage-independent code, ready for the future desktop edition.
- Every new record (organizations, accounts, statement checks, year-end closes, import batches, history entries, categories) now gets its ID from the app instead of the database.
- Discarding a statement check now requires permission to edit the books.
- Bookkeeping rules and save/void workflows now run in shared, storage-independent code, so future desktop and self-hosted editions behave the same as the cloud app.
- App name standardized to OpenLedgerApp across screens, legal notices, reports, and documentation.
- Page titles use OpenLedgerApp for home and Page Name - OpenLedgerApp elsewhere.
- Public home is now `/`; the existing authenticated dashboard is at `/ledger`.
- Public website does not advertise or link the development preview or shared demo.
- Consistent section spacing across the website and app.

### Removed

- Marketing strips and eyebrow badges above headlines on the public website.
- Legal mailing address from legal notices; contact is by email only.
- Em dashes and en dashes from all user-facing copy.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-10-01

Initial usable web foundation.

### Added

- Organization-scoped double-entry accounting, chart of accounts, opening balances, and transaction register.
- Money in, money out, transfers, and advanced entry flows with duplicate-submit protection.
- CSV, OFX/QFX, and reviewed PDF bank imports; reconciliation and completion locks.
- Income statement, balance sheet, trial balance, project reporting, and PDF exports.
- Business/nonprofit terminology, basic fund tags, projects, and organization settings.
- Member roles, email and Google sign-in, password recovery, and versioned legal acceptance.
- Books-lock dates and virtual year-end close.
- Automated unit tests, database-rule checks, CI, and deployment documentation.

### Security and data integrity

- Balanced-entry enforcement, organization isolation, and permission checks.
- Posted transactions corrected by voiding and re-entry rather than destructive editing.
- Bank evidence protection, account archiving, and reconciliation locks.
- Startup data-safety safeguards and manual development-only sample seeding.

### Known limitations

- Pre-1.0 development software; review results and keep independent backups.
- Fund tags are not full nonprofit fund accounting.
- No standalone desktop installer, automated bank feeds, payroll, or tax filing.
